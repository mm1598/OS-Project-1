Initialized repository for CS4348 Project 1. Reviewed both provided PDFs. Outlined project structure: three Python scripts (logger.py, encryptor.py, driver.py), plus devlog.md and README.md. No external libraries, Linux compatibility required. Plan is to start by implementing logger.py. Pushed empty initial files with placeholder docstrings.

Finished logger.py. Takes log file destination as argument, reads actions/messages from stdin, writes to log file with YYYY-MM-DD HHMM timestamp. Ending on QUIT line per spec. Manual tests: lines appear in file and timestamp is formatted as required.
