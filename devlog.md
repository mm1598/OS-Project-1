Initialized repository for CS4348 Project 1. Reviewed both provided PDFs. Outlined project structure: three Python scripts (logger.py, encryptor.py, driver.py), plus devlog.md and README.md. No external libraries, Linux compatibility required. Plan is to start by implementing logger.py. Pushed empty initial files with placeholder docstrings.
